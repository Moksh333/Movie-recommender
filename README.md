# Movie-Recommender
This is a content-based movie recommender system built using the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset. It uses cosine similarity on combined movie metadata (genres, cast, keywords, etc.) to recommend similar movies. A Streamlit web app allows users to interact with the model and view recommended movie posters fetched via the TMDB API.
